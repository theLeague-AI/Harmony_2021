    "The Banana Company Inc. is a new mobile phone company wanting to disrupt the mobile phone business. Banana wants to compete with Apple and get in on this competitive market. However, since they are brand new to the game, they are seeking a Machine Learning Engineer (that’s YOU!) to help them estimate the most optimal price to sell their mobile phones. \n",

The goal is to build a model that can estimate the price of any given phone based on the phone features. Having a machine learning model that can estimate the price range of any phone will give Banana Inc. a strategic advantage when deciding how to price their own phones. \n",
